#0053 The system shall support outputting and appending questions and answers to a log file
#0054 The system shall throw an exception if the interface output logfile is not a string
#0100 The system shall return 'Yes' or 'No' when asked 'Is the <file path> in the repo?'
#0101 The system shall return one of the following when asked 'What is the status of <file path>?'
         - <file path> has been modified locally
         - <file path> has not been checked in
         - <file path> is a dirty repo
         - <file path> is up to date
#0102 The system shall return '<hash>, <date modified>, <author>' when asked 'What is the deal with <file path>?'
#0103 The system shall return the repo branch when asked 'What branch is <file path>?'
#0104 The system shall return the repo url when asked 'Where did <file path> come from?'
*When I ask "What time is it?" I want to be given the current date/time so I can stay up to date
*When I ask "What is the n digit of fibonacci" I want to receive the answer so I don't have to figure it out myself
*When I ask "What is the n digit of pi" I want to receive the answer so I don't have to figure it out myself
*When I ask "Please clear memory" I was the application to clear user set questions and answers so I can reset the application
*When I say "Open the door hal", I want the application to say "I'm afraid I can't do that <user name> so I know that is not an option
*When I ask "Convert <number> <units> to <units>" I want to receive the converted value and units so I can know the answer.
*When I ask for a numberic conversion I want at least 10 different units I can convert from/to
